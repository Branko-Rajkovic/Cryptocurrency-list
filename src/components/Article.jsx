      <h3>Key Trends</h3>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>1. Institutional Adoption</h4>
      <p>
        Major companies and financial institutions are increasingly integrating
        cryptocurrencies into their operations. Payment giants like Visa and
        Mastercard, as well as investment firms, are exploring crypto for
        transactions and asset management.

      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>2. Regulation</h4>
      <p>
        Governments worldwide are crafting frameworks to regulate
        cryptocurrencies. Clear and favorable regulations could encourage
        broader adoption, while overly restrictive policies might hinder growth.

      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>3. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</h4>
      <p>
        Many countries are developing their own digital currencies. While these
        may compete with decentralized cryptocurrencies, they could also
        validate and normalize the use of blockchain-based assets.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>4. DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</h4>
      <p>
        DeFi continues to revolutionize traditional financial systems, offering
        decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. This sector is
        expected to grow as it matures and gains trust.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>5. Blockchain Scalability and Innovation</h4>
      <p>
        Improvements in blockchain technology, such as Ethereum 2.0, Layer 2
        solutions, and new consensus mechanisms, aim to enhance scalability,
        security, and sustainability.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">Opportunities</h3>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>1. Financial Inclusion</h4>

        Cryptocurrencies can provide banking solutions to unbanked populations,
        enabling global financial participation.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>2. Tokenization of Assets</h4>
      <p>
        Physical and intangible assets like real estate, art, and intellectual
        property can be tokenized, increasing liquidity and market access.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>3. Cross-Border Payments</h4>
      <p>
        Crypto offers faster and cheaper international transactions, disrupting
        traditional remittance systems.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>4. Metaverse and NFTs</h4>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies are integral to the growth of the metaverse and
        non-fungible tokens (NFTs), driving digital ownership and virtual
        economies.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">Challenges</h3>
      <h4>1. Volatility</h4>
      <p>
        High price volatility remains a barrier for cryptocurrencies being
        widely used as a medium of exchange.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>2. Environmental Concerns</h4>
      <p>
        Energy-intensive proof-of-work systems, like Bitcoin mining, face
        criticism. Adoption of eco-friendly protocols is critical.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>3. Cybersecurity Risks</h4>
      <p>
        Hacks and scams undermine trust in crypto ecosystems. Enhanced security
        measures are vital.
      </p>
      <img src="/horizontal_rule.png" className="h-10" />
      <h4>4. Regulatory Uncertainty</h4>
      <p>
        Inconsistent or hostile regulations could stifle innovation and adoption
        in certain regions.

        The future of cryptocurrency is promising but contingent on innovation,
        regulation, and adoption. Key milestones to watch include:
